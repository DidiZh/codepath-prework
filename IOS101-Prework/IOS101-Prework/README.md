App Idea
App Name (tentative): TagTalk

TagTalk is a community-based social app where users can explore and participate in topic-driven channels organized by tags. Each tag (e.g., #Travel, #Movies, #Books, #MentalHealth) functions like a category, and under each tag, there are open discussion threads or channels where users can post their thoughts, experiences, or questions. Think of it as a blend of Reddit and Douban, a space for people to connect over shared interests and have meaningful, interest-specific conversations. Core features will include tag browsing, post creation within channels, comment and reply systems, and user profiles that show personal tag activity.
